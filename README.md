# 🏦 Bank Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a bank customer is likely to leave the bank (churn) or continue using the services.

It uses machine learning to analyze customer details like credit score, balance, activity status, and more to make predictions.

The project also includes an interactive web application built using Streamlit.

## 🚀 Features

* Predict customer churn using trained ML model
* Interactive and clean UI using Streamlit
* Real-time prediction with probability score
* User-friendly input system (sliders, dropdowns)
* Displays churn vs stay probability

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Streamlit
* Matplotlib, Seaborn

Dependencies used:
(see requirements.txt) 

---

## 📊 Dataset

* Bank Customer Churn Dataset
* Contains customer details such as:

  * Credit Score
  * Age
  * Geography
  * Balance
  * Number of Products
  * Active Status
  * Estimated Salary

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters customer details in the Streamlit app
2. Data is encoded and processed
3. Trained model (`churn_model.pkl`) is used
4. Prediction is generated
5. Result + probability is displayed
